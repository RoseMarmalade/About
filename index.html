    <p>
        My name is Mara Gilmartin, and I'm a first year Game Design & Development student at the Rochester Insititute of Technology.
        I enjoy programming, and have experience working with both the Java and C# programming languages.
    </p>

    <p> I love cats, computers, and games!</p>
    <p>
        I am currently seeking a temporary summer 2020 position with relevance to programming or game development. My previous employers have found me to be productive and reliable, and I work hard to learn new skills as needed to someday become a fully-fledged professional game developer.</p>
